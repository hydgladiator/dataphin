# Create Alibaba Cloud accounts {#concept_s5j_4g5_zgb .concept}

This topic describes how to create an Alibaba cloud account.

## Alibaba Cloud account introduction {#section_kz5_542_2hb .section}

You can use an Alibaba Cloud account or a RAM user account to log on to Dataphin. For more information about the two types of accounts, see [What is RAM?](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is RAM?.md#).

-   An Alibaba Cloud account owns Alibaba Cloud resources. Resource usage is measured and billed to the Alibaba Cloud account. The Alibaba Cloud account allows you to create RAM user accounts that belong to your enterprise. You can also use the Alibaba Cloud account to manage and authorize RAM users.
-   RAM users are created and managed by the Alibaba Cloud account in the RAM system. RAM users do not own resources. The resource usage of a RAM user is not measured and billed to the RAM user account. The Alibaba Cloud account centrally controls all RAM users, including the payment for resources used by RAM users.

Therefore, you must have an Alibaba Cloud account and manage your RAM user accounts in RAM before using Dataphin.

## Real-name authentication {#section_rjp_dp2_2hb .section}

Log on to your Alibaba Cloud account and click your profile picture in the upper-right corner. The system displays a message indicating that real-name authentication is required. Click **Certification**. On the page that appears, specify required information to complete real-name authentication.

**Note:** 

-   Only an Alibaba Cloud account that is authenticated with a real name can purchase and use all services in Alibaba Cloud.
-   If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you complete the enterprise-level authentication for more convenience.
