# Overview

The scheduling center consists of three modules: tasks, instances, and logical tables.

## Enter the Scheduling page

You can access the scheduling center by using the following two methods:

-   In the top navigation bar of the Dataphin homepage, click **R&D**, and then select the **Scheduling** tab to open the Scheduling page.
-   On the Dataphin homepage, you can open the Scheduling page from its quick access area.

    Select **Scheduling and Management** in the central workspace, or click **Enter** in the **Scheduling** section in the upper-right corner to go to the Scheduling page, as shown in the following figure.

For projects in the production environment and development environment, the scheduling center is independent of each other. You can switch to the required environment by clicking the switch in the upper-left corner. When the switch is set to Dev, it indicates that you have switched to the development environment. When the switch is set to Prod, it indicates that you have switched to the production environment. After switching environment from the current environment to another environment, you enter the Scheduling page of the new environment, and the page is also updated to display the counterpart project that corresponds to the new environment. For example, on the Scheduling page of the Test\_dev project in the development environment, if you switch to the production environment, the Scheduling page of the Test counterpart project is displayed.

The scheduled task instances in the production environment are generated and run as expected, you can configure monitoring and alerts for these tasks. The scheduled task instances in the development environment are also generated but are paused and not executed by default, you cannot configure monitoring and alerts for these tasks.

The scheduling center classified tasks, instances, and logical tables into different types. Move the pointer over the left icon to display the navigation submenu. Select the task or instance type you want to view to go to the Scheduling page of the corresponding task or instance. After you enter the scheduling center, the **Recurring Tasks** \> **Code & Sync Tasks** tab page is displayed.

## Tasks

A task is an object that is published online after all scripts are submitted. It can be periodically or manually triggered. Each task has a scheduling configuration and is also called a node. The tasks in scheduling are classified into two node types: recurring task nodes and one-time task nodes. The recurring task nodes have pre-configured recurrence settings and are repeatedly executed by the scheduling system of Dataphin. Each execution generates a corresponding recurring task instance. The one-time task nodes are nodes that are not automatically triggered. You can manually execute a node as needed. Each execution generates a corresponding one-time task instance.

**Note:** The task execution sequence is determined based on the configured recurrence settings, dependency, and task priority.

-   If the node code or configuration is updated before 23:00 \(UTC+8\) every night, the task instance will be generated based on the updated code or configuration for the next day. Otherwise, the task instance will be generated based on the old code or configuration for the next day.
-   When the instance is running, the latest node code and scheduling configuration are read.
-   The time range supported by retroactive data generation tasks scheduling is from January 1, 1970 to January 1, 2099. The maximum retention period for the scheduled instance information is two weeks.

## Instances

Each time a task node runs, an instance is generated. There are three types of instances: recurring task instance, one-time task instance, and retroactive data generation instances. A recurring instance is automatically generated by a recurring task node and is repeatedly triggered by system scheduling. A retroactive data generation instance is generated by performing retroactive data generation operations on nodes. A one-time instance is generated by running one-time task nodes.

## Logical Tables

The Logical Tables section consists of two pages. One is the Logical Table Tasks page, which shows the internal task relationship from the perspective of a logical table. The other is the Logical Table Instances page, which shows the node instances and their statuses contained in a running logical table task.

## Note

The resource consumption during the beta phase is described as follows:

-   Scheduling resources of a 40-core CPU and 160 GB memory are allocated to each tenant. The synchronization speed may be affected by too many concurrent sync tasks or a large volume of data to be synchronized.
-   No additional fee is charged for scheduling resources that consume resources such as sync tasks and scheduling.

**Note:** 40-core CPU and 160 GB memory indicates that 40 cores of the CPU and 160 GB of memory resources are allocated to your ECS instance. For more details about ECS, see [What is ECS?](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is ECS?.md).
